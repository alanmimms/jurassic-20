1.0	ABSTRACT

	THIS PDP-10 KL10 BASIC INSTRUCTION DIAGNOSTIC IS THE FIRST IN A
	SERIES OF PDP-10 KL10 PROCESSOR DIAGNOSTICS.  IT IS THE MOST
	BASIC OF THE PROCESSOR DIAGNOSTICS.  THIS DIAGNOSTIC
	ASSUMES THE HALT INSTRUCTION AND THE COMPUTER CONSOLE
	TO BE OPERATIVE.  IT MAKES NO FURTHER ASSUMPTIONS EXCEPT
	THAT IT IS LOADED INTO MEMORY CORRECTLY.

	THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS THE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PROCESSOR
	AND MICRO-CODE.

2.0	REQUIREMENTS

2.1	EQUIPMENT

	EITHER OF:
	A PDP-10 KL10 WITH A MINIMUM OF 32K OF MEMORY

	CONSOLE PROCESSOR
	CONSOLE TELETYPE

2.2	STORAGE

	THE PROGRAM RUNS WITHIN 32K OF MEMORY.

2.3	PRELIMINARY PROGRAMS

	CONSOLE FUNCTIONS WORKING PROPERLY

3.0	PROGRAM PROCEDURES

3.1	LOADING PROCEDURE

	LOAD VIA CONSOLE PROCESSOR

3.2	STARTING PROCEDURE

	STAND-ALONE STARTING ADDRESS IS 30000.

	IF THE DIAGNOSTIC FAILS TO START CORRECTLY TRY STARTING AT THE
	FIRST TEST INSTEAD OF AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CONTROL SEQUENCE.
	(SEE LISTING).

3.3	OPERATING PROCEDURE

	ONCE STARTED THE PROGRAM WILL CYCLE CONTINUALLY UNTIL STOPPED
	OR AN ERROR OCCURS.

4.0	ERRORS

	ERRORS ARE IN THE FORM OF HALT INSTRUCTIONS.  THE LISTING
	SHOULD BE CONSULTED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE ERROR.  A
	NO OPERATION (JUMP) INSTRUCTION FOLLOWS EACH HALT.  THIS
	MAY BE USEFUL IN CONSTRUCTING A SCOPE LOOP TO CYCLE ON THE
	FAILING INSTRUCTION.

5.0	ITERATION COUNTER

	THE ITERATION COUNT OF THE PROGRAM IS PRINTED BY THE CONSOLE
	PROCESSOR.

6.0	CYCLE TIME

	THE CYCLE TIME OF THE PROGRAM IS IN THE MILLISECOND RANGE AND
	IS THEREFORE SUITABLE FOR TAKING MARGINS, VIBRATION TESTS, ETC.

7.0	OPERATIONAL VARIATIONS

	A.  DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR

	    THE PROGRAM IS USABLE WITH THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR TO PRO-
	    VIDE RELIABILITY TESTS, ACCEPTANCE TESTS, AND/OR TO PRO-
	    VIDE A QUICK METHOD OF ISOLATION OF A FAULT TO A PARTICULAR
	    AREA OF THE PROCESSOR.  CERTAIN PROCEDURES ARE USED WHEN
	    THE PROGRAM IS USED IN THIS MANNER.  THEY ARE:

	    1.  THE DIAGNOSTIC MONITOR TRANSFERS CONTROL TO THE PRO-
		GRAM AND STARTS IT AT LOCATION 30002.

	    2.  MONCTL - LOCATION 30043 IS USED AS THE DIAGNOSTIC MON-
		ITOR CONTROL FLAG WORD.

	B.  USER MODE

	    THE PROGRAM WILL OPERATE IN USER MODE AND AS SUCH PROVIDES
	    ASSURANCE THAT THE PROCESSOR IS PERFORMING ALL FUNCTIONS
	    CORRECTLY.  USER MODE STARTING ADDRESS IS 30000.

	C.  SYSTEM EXERCISER

	    STARTING ADDRESS IS 30003.  NO DATA SWITCHES ARE USED BY
	    THIS PROGRAM.
