3.0	FILE FORMATS

	THE PROGRAM FILES CONSIST OF BINARY DATA WHICH HAS BEEN
	"ASCIIZED", THAT IS, MANIPULATED SUCH THAT 6 OR LESS BITS
	OF THE BINARY DATA ARE REPRESENTED BY A 7-BIT CHARACTER
	WHOSE VALUE RANGES FROM OCTAL 075 TO OCTAL 174.  THIS
	PROCESS IS EMPLOYED TO AVOID THE PROBLEMS WHICH WOULD BE
	ENCOUNTERED IF CERTIAN 7-BIT COMBINATIONS WERE ALLOWED
	(E.G., OCTAL 003 WOULD BE INTERPRETED AS "CONTROL C").

	"ASCIIZED" DATA IS PRODUCED FROM THE SOURCE BINARY DATA AS
	FOLLOWS:

	1.  DIVIDE THE BINARY DATA INTO 6-BIT FIELDS, STARTING WITH
	    THE LEAST SIGNIFICANT 6 BITS.  DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER
	    OF BITS IN THE SOURCE DATA, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FIELD
	    MAY BE COMPOSED OF FROM 1 TO 6 BITS.

	2.  CONVERT EACH FIELD INTO A 7-BIT CHARACTER USING THE
	    FOLLOWING PROCEDURE:

	   2A.	IF THE FIELD HAS A VALUE LESS THAN OCTAL 75, ADD
		OCTAL 100 (PRODUCING 7-BIT VALUES RANGING FROM
		OCTAL 100 TO OCTAL 174).

	   2B.	IF THE FIELD HAS VALUES OCTAL 75, 76, OR 77 USE
		THE FIELD DIRECTLY (PRODUCING 7-BIT VALUES 075,
		076, OR 077).

	EXAMPLE:

	A 16 BIT WORD CONTAINING OCTAL 176076 IS DIVIDED INTO 3 FIELDS
	(ONE 4-BIT AND TWO 6-BIT):

		17, 60, 76

	THE FIELDS ARE CONVERTED INTO 7-BIT CHARACTERS:

		117, 160, 076

	WHICH ARE THE ASCII CODES FOR THE GRAPHICS:

		O, LOWER CASE P, >

	DATA, THE LINE CHECKSUM AND THE FORMAT CHARACTERS.

	THE FILE LINE CHECKSUM IS THE 16 BIT NEGATED CHECKSUM THAT
	WHEN THE WORD COUNT, THE LOAD ADDRESS, THE DATA AND THE
	CHECKSUM ARE ADDED TOGETHER PRODUCES A 16 BIT ZERO SUM.

5.0	PDP-10 FILE FORMATS

	PDP-10 PROGRAMS ARE ASSEMBLED, LOADED AND SAVED WHICH THEN
	CREATES A PDP-10 FILE IMAGE AS GIVEN IN THE FOLLOWING
	DESCRIPTION:

	PDP-10 ASCIIZED FILE FORMAT
	---------------------------

	PDP-10 ASCIIZED FILES ARE COMPOSED OF THREE TYPES OF
	FILE LOAD LINES.  THEY ARE:

	A.	CORE ZERO LINE

	THIS LOAD FILE LINE SPECIFIES WHERE AND HOW MUCH PDP-10 CORE
	TO BE ZEROED.  THIS IS NECESSARY AS THE PDP-10 FILES ARE
	ZERO COMPRESSED WHICH MEANS THAT ZERO WORDS ARE NOT INCLUDED
	IN THE LOAD FILE TO CONSERVE FILE SPACE.

	  CORE ZERO LINE

		Z WC,ADR,COUNT,...,CKSUM

		Z = PDP-10 CORE ZERO
		WORD COUNT = 1 TO 4
		ADR = ZERO START ADDRESS
			DERIVED FROM C(JOBSA)
		COUNT = ZERO COUNT, 64K MAX
			DERIVED FROM C(JOBFF)

	IF THE ADDRESSES ARE GREATER THAN 64K THE HI 2-BITS OF
	THE 18 BIT PDP-10 ADDRESS ARE INCLUDED AS THE HI-BYTE OF
	THE WORD COUNT.

	D.	SUPER '.A10' LOAD FILE LINES

	THESE LOAD FILE LINES PROVIDE A MORE COMPRESSED ASCIIZED
	REPRESENTATION OF THE BINARY SAVE FILE.

	DATA IS REPRESENTED AS 36 BIT WORDS WITH LEADING ZERO 6 BIT
	OITS SUPPRESSED, INTERMEDIATE ZERO 6 BIT OITS SUPPRESSED AND
	AN ALTERNATE CHARACTER SUBSTITUTED TO REPRESENT THE AMOUNT OF
	ZERO 6 BIT OITS SUPPRESSED, AND 77 6 BIT OITS SUPPRESSED AND

6.0	KL10 MICRO CODE FILE FORMATS

	THE KL10 MICRO CODE FILE CONSISTS OF TWO DIFFERENT TYPES
	OF DATA.

	THE CONTROL RAM CONSISTS OF 80 BITS PLUS A 5 BIT SPECIAL
	FIELD PER CONTROL RAM LOCATION.  THIS THEN REQUIRES SIX
	16 BIT WORDS TO REPRESENT THE CONTROL RAM DATA.  THE LOAD
	FILE IS ARRANGED SO AS FACILITATE LOADING OF THE C-RAM WITH
	THE "WCRAM" ROUTINE.

	THE DISPATCH RAM CONSISTS OF PAIRS OF LOCATIONS.  THIS
	THEN REQUIRES THREE 16 BIT WORDS PER PAIR OF D-RAM LOCATIONS.
	THIS FILE IS ARRANGED TO FACILITATE LOADING OF THE D-RAM 
	WITH THE "WDRAM" ROUTINE.

	BOTH THE C-RAM AND D-RAM DATA ARE COMBINED INTO A SINGLE
	LOAD FILE TO FACILITATE HANDLING AND TO KEEP THE ASSOCIATED
	VERSIONS TOGETHER.

	THE MICRO CODE LOAD FILE ALSO CONTAINS A C-RAM ZERO LINE
	USED TO ZERO THE CONTROL RAM BEFORE LOADING ANY DATA INTO
	IT.  THE C-RAM IS ZEROED FROM LOCATION ZERO UP TO THE HIGHEST
	USED C-RAM LOCATION.

	IF THE MICRO-CODE DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY DATA IN C-RAM LOCATION
	0, THE "Z" BLOCK IS NOT DONE WHICH PREVENTS C-RAM ZEROING AND
	ALLOWS FOR MICRO-CODE OVERLAYS TO BE GENERATED.

	EXAMPLE FILE:

	Z WC,ADR,CKS
	C WC,ADR,DATA,DATA,...,CKSUM
	C  "

	KMC11 MICROCODE IS ASSEMBLED WITH MACY11 ON A DECSYSTEM10
	WHICH PRODUCES A KMC11 BINARY FILE ON THE PDP-10 DISK OF 
	THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

	KMC11 BINARY FILE FORMAT
	-------------------------

		KMC11 BINARY ON 10 DISK - 36 BIT WORDS

		BYTE 2/BYTE 1,,BYTE 4/BYTE 3
		     6      5,,     8      7
		    10      9,,    12     11
			ETC.

		ACTUAL FORMAT

		FRAME	0	001	;START FRAME
			1	000	;NULL
			2	XXX	;BYTE COUNT LOW 8 BITS
			3	XXX	;BYTE COUNT HIGH 8 BITS
			4	YYY	;LOAD ADDRESS LOW 8 BITS
			5	YYY	;LOAD ADDRESS HIGH 8 BITS
			6	NNN
				 .
				 .	;DATA BYTES
				 .
				NNN
				ZZZ	;BLOCK CHECKSUM

	ADDRESSES LESS THAN 100000 ARE DIVIDED BY 2 TO GIVE THE KMC11
	C-RAM ADDRESS.  ADDRESSES EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 100000
	SIGNIFY KMC11 D-RAM ADDRESSES AND HAVE 100000 SUBTRACTED FROM
	THEM TO GIVE THE D-RAM ADDRESS.

	KMC11 C-RAM DATA IS 16 BITS AND KMC11 D-RAM DATA IS 8 BITS.

	THE BINARY TRANSFER BLOCK SIGNIFIES THE KMC11 C-RAM START
	ADDRESS.

	WC	;WORD COUNT

	D	;KMC11 D-RAM FILE IDENTIFIER
	 	;SPACE, SIGNIFIES ASCIIZED FILE
	WC	;WORD COUNT
	ADR	;LOAD ADDRESS
	12	;UP TO 2 CHARS FOR EACH 8-BIT DATA WORD
	CKS	;FILE LINE CHECKSUM
	CR/LF	;END OF LINE

	AS MANY LINES OF THIS TYPE AS REQUIRED TO LOAD THE KMC11
	FILE, DEPENDS ON SIZE OF FILE.

	C	;KMC11 IDENTIFIER
		;SPACE, SIGNIFIES ASCIIZED FILE
	0	;WORD COUNT, WC OF ZERO SIGNIFIES TRANSFER BLOCK
	ADR	;KMC11 C-RAM STARTING ADDRESS
	CKS	;FILE LINE CHECKSUM
	CR/LF	;END OF LINE

	THERE IS A MAXIMUM OF 30 16/8 BIT DATA WORDS PER FILE LINE
	WHICH PRODUCES A MAXIMUM OF 131/101 CHARACTERS PER LINE
	COUNTING THE FILE IDENTIFIER, THE WORD COUNT, THE LOAD
	ADDRESS, THE  DATA, THE LINE CHECKSUM AND THE FORMAT
	CHARACTERS.

	THE FILE LINE CHECKSUM IS THE 16 BIT NEGATED CHECKSUM THAT
	WHEN THE WORD COUNT, THE LOAD ADDRESS, THE DATA AND THE
	CHECKSUM ARE ADDED TOGETHER PRODUCES A 16 BIT ZERO SUM.

11.0	OCTAL FILE FORMATS

	ANY OF THE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED FILE FORMATS MAY BE
	PATCHED, CREATED OR UPDATED BY USING THE OCTAL FILE FORMAT
	CAPABILITY.  IN THE ASCIIZED FILE FORMAT THE SECOND CHARACTER
	ON A LINE (THE SPACE) SIGNIFIES THAT THIS LINE IS IN ASCIIZED
	FORMAT.  TO CREATE A FILE LINE IN THE OCTAL FORMAT THE 
	SECOND CHARACTER IS AN "O" AND THE DATA IS INSERTED IN OCTAL,
	THAT IS USING THE OCTAL CHARACTERS 0 THRU 7, THE FILE WHEN
	LOADED THEN USES ONLY THE THREE LEAST SIGNIFICANT BITS OF THE
	CORESPONDING CHARACTER.  ALSO AN OCTAL FILE LINE DOES NOT
	INCLUDE THE CHECKSUM SO THAT ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO COMPUTE
	THIS WHEN CREATING THE FILE.

	ONE SHOULD LIMIT THE LINE LENGTH OF THE OCTAL FILE LINE TO
	132 CHARACTERS.

12.0	SPECIFIED FILE EXTENSIONS

	THE DECSYTEM 10/20 FILES HAVE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIED
	FILE EXTENSIONS TO DESTINGUISH THE FILE TYPES.

	A.	.BIN	;PDP-11 BINARY LOAD FILE
	B.	.A11	;PDP-11 ASCIIZED LOAD FILE
	C.	.RAM	;KL10 MICRO CODE LOAD FILE
	D.	.A10	;PDP-10 ASCIIZED LOAD FILE
	E.	.A8	;PDP-8 ASCIIZED LOAD FILE
	F.	.ADX	;DX20 ASCIIZED LOAD FILE
	G.	.KMC	;KMC11 ASCIIZED LOAD FILE

13.0	FILE IDENTIFICATION

	ALL FILES (EXCEPT FOR PDP-11 .BIN) HAVE AS THE FIRST LINE
	ENTRY IN THE FILE A FILE IDENTIFICATION ENTRY WHICH PROVIDES
	INTERNAL FILE IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION.

	FORMAT:	(ALL BUT .RAM)

	;FILE.EXT   VER #.#   DD-MMM-YY

	FORMAT:	(.RAM)

	;FILE.EXT   VER #.#   "MICRO-CODE .TITLE INFORMATION"
