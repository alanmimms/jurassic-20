3.0	DIAGNOSTIC CONSOLE OPERATIONS (CON'T)

	THE PDP-10 IS LOGICALLY SUPPORTED BY THE CONSOLE IN THREE
	OPERATIONAL MODES.  THESE THREE MODES ARE:

	1.	DIAGNOSTIC CONSOLE

		ALL OPERATOR COMMANDS ARE VALID.

	2.	PDP-10 RUNNING DIAGNOSTIC SUPPORT

		THE FOLLOWING OPERATOR COMMANDS REQUIRE THAT THE PDP-10
		BE STOPPED BEFORE EXECUTION:

		A. DIAGNOSTIC FUNCTIONS
		B. INTERNAL E-BOX REGISTER READS
		C. PULSE THE CLOCK
		D. CLOCK RATE/SOURCE CHANGES
		E. MICRO TIME/MARK/UNMARK FUNCTIONS
		F. C-RAM AND D-RAM EXAMINES AND DEPOSITS
		G. CACHE INVALIDATE AND FLUSH
		H. PDP-10 MEMORY ZEROING
		I. AC BLOCK SELECTION

		THE PDP-10 PROGRAM COUNTER (PC) IS THE ONLY INTERNAL
		REGISTER THAT MAY BE EXAMINED WHILE THE PDP-10 IS
		RUNNING AND THIS OPERATION IS PERFORMED BY THE CONSOLE
		BY STOPPING THE PDP-10, STOPPING THE KL10 CLOCK,
		PERFORMING THE DIAGNOSTIC FUNCTION READS REQUIRED TO
		READ THE PROGRAM COUNTER AND THEN RESTARTING THE PDP-10.

		********** CAUTION **********

		THE PC EXAMINE OPERATION MAY CAUSE DEVICE OVERRUNS
		TO HAPPEN.

	3.	PDP-10 TIMESHARING SUPPORT

		WHEN THE CONSOLE IS SUPPORTING TIMESHARING THE CONSOLE
		TTY BELONGS TO THE PDP-10 TIMESHARING SYSTEM AND ALL
		TTY INPUT GOES TO THE PDP-10 AND ALL TTY OUTPUT
		ORIGINATES IN THE PDP-10.
	DECSYSTEM10 KL10 DIAGNOSTIC CONSOLE PROGRAM
	-------------------------------------------

3.0	DIAGNOSTIC CONSOLE OPERATIONS (CON'T)

	THE DIAGNOSTIC CONSOLE IS A TWO PART PROGRAM WITH THE MAJOR
	PORTION RESIDENT IN THE UPPER 12K OF THE PDP-11.  THE UPPER
	PORTION SUPPORTS ALL DIAGNOSTIC OPERATIONS AND THE LOWER
	PORTION PROVIDES UTILITY SUPPORT.

	CERTAIN OF THE CONSOLE COMMANDS REQUIRE THAT THE UTILITY PORTION
	OF THE CONSOLE BE RESIDENT.  SINCE THE UTILITY PORTION RESIDES
	IN THE LOWER PART OF THE PDP-11 STARTING AT ADDRESS 3000, ONCE
	LOADED IT WILL REMAIN RESIDENT UNTIL OVERWRITTEN BY OTHER
	LOWER CORE DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAMS.

	THE CONSOLE WILL PERFORM A VALIDITY CHECK OF THE UTILITY PORTION
	AND WILL REQUEST THAT THE OPERATOR LOAD "KLDCPU.A11" IF IT IS
	NOT RESIDENT WHEN ANY UTILITY COMMAND IS PERFORMED.

	THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS ARE UTILITY COMMANDS AND ARE PERFORMED
	VIA THE "DIAGNOSTIC CONSOLE UTILITY":

	1.	DTCOPY

		DECTAPE COPY

	2.	RXCOPY

		RX01/RX11 FLOPPY DISKETTE COPY

	3.	WF

		WRITE FILE FROM DECTAPE/FLOPPY TO RP04

	4.	TA

		TRANSFER FILE FROM APT10 TO RP04

	5.	DI  "IF RP04 SELECTED"

		RP04 DISK DIRECTORY

	6.	TT

		REMOTE TELETYPE OPERATION

3.1	GENERAL INFORMATION

		THE DIAGNOSTIC CONSOLE PROGRAM WHEN LOADED AND STARTED
	WILL PERFORM ALL INTERNAL INITIALIZATION REQUIRED BY THE 
	SOFTWARE AND PDP-11 HARDWARE INCLUDING SETTING THE STACK,
	CLEARING COMMON STORAGE AREAS, SETTING UP THE INTERRUPT AND
	TRAP VECTORS.  THIS ACTION IS NOT VISIBLE TO THE OPERATOR AND
	WHEN THE INTERNAL INITIALIZATION IS COMPLETED THE SOFTWARE
	WILL TYPE:

	DECSYSTEM10 DIAGNOSTIC CONSOLE
	VERSION ##.##

	COMMAND:

3.1	GENERAL INFORMATION (CON'T)


	PDP-11 OPERATIONS
	-----------------

	START 11 AT ADDRESS ######

	EX:	SE 3000

	THIS COMMAND WILL CAUSE THE PDP-11 TO BEGIN EXECUTING CODE
	AT PDP-11 CORE MEMORY ADDRESS 3000.  CHECKING IS PERFORMED
	TO INSURE THAT AN ODD ADDRESS START IS NOT ATTEMPTED
	AND THAT ADDRESS 0 IS NOT USED.  THE BASE ADDRESS OF THE STACK
	IS PASSED IN R0.

	EXAMINE 11 AT ADDRESS ######

	EX:	EE 1000

	THIS COMMAND WILL EXAMINE AND PRINT THE CONTENTS OF THE SELECTED
	PDP-11 LOCATION.  EXAMINES ARE WORD BASED AND AN EXAMINE ATTEMPT
	OF AN ODD LOCATION WILL PRINT OUT AN ERROR.

	1.  TP NUM		;SET TTY PAGE SIZE
	2.  TW NUM		;SET TTY PAGE WIDTH
	3.  TF NUM		;SET TTY FILL CONTROL

	TP NUM
	------

	THIS COMMAND SETS THE TTY FOR THE NUMBER OF LINES ON A PAGE.
	IF THE NUMBER SET FOR LINES ON A PAGE IS NON-ZERO, THE
	DIAGNOSTIC TERMINAL HANDLER WILL SUSPEND OUTPUT
	(WITH THE PRINT HEAD AT THE END OF THE LAST LINE OUTPUT)
	AFTER EXACTLY N LINES OF CONSECUTIVE OUTPUT WITH NO
	INTERVENING INPUT.  WHEN A PROGRAM ASKS FOR INPUT THE
	TERMINAL HANDLER RESETS THE DOWN COUNTER TO N.
	THE OPERATOR MAY CONTINUE OUTPUT BY TYPING (XON).

	TP 0
	----

	THIS COMMAND TURNS OFF THE AUTOMATIC PAGE FEATURE AND IS THE
	DEFAULT INITIAL SETTING.

	TW NUM
	------

	THIS COMMAND SETS THE TTY PAGE WIDTH.  DEFAULT INITIAL SETTING
	IS 80. MININUM ALLOWED SETTING IS 10 AND MAXIMUM IS 132.
	A FREE CR/LF IS INSERTED INTO THE TTY OUTPUT IF THE LINE
	LENGTH EXCEEDS THIS COUNT.

	TF NUM
	------

	THIS COMMAND SETS THE TTY FILL COUNT.  ALLOWED FILL COUNTS ARE:

	0 = 110 BAUD	;NO FILLERS
	1 = 150 BAUD	;NO FILLERS
	2 = 300 BAUD	;CR = 9	LF = 0

B.	TELETYPE SPECIAL CHARACTER FEATURES

	XOFF (^S)
	----

	THE OPERATOR MAY STOP OUTPUT ON THE TTY AT ANY TIME BY TYPING
	IN XOFF (CONTROL S).  THE XOFF DOES NOT ECHO AND IS DISCARDED
	BY THE TERMINAL HANDLER SO THE DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAMS NEVER SEE
	IT.  THE OUTPUT IS STOPPED IMMEDIATELY WITH THE CURSOR LEFT
	AFTER THE LAST CHARACTER OUTPUT.  BY LEAVING THE CURSOR
	AT THE END OF THE PARTIAL LINE, IT SERVES AS A WARNING TO
	THE OPERATOR THAT HE HAS STOPPED OUTPUT AND THE DIAGNOSTIC
	IS WAITING FOR HIM TO TYPE XON TO CONTINUE OUTPUT.

	XON (^Q)
	---

	THE OPERATOR MAY CONTINUE OUTPUT WHICH HAS BEEN STOPPED BY 
	TYPING XON (CONTROL Q).  THE XON DOES NOT ECHO AND
	THE TERMINAL HANDLER DOES NOT PASS IT ON TO THE THE DIAGNOSTIC
	PROGRAM.

	CONTROL O (^O)
	---------

	A CONTROL O (^O) TYPED DURING A TELETYPE PRINTOUT FUNCTION
	PREVENTS THE REMAINDER OF THE CURRENT LINE FROM BEING PRINTED.
	TELETYPE PRINTOUT IS TURNED BACK ON FOR THE NEXT ^O, FOR
	FORCED PRINTOUT AND WHEN TTY INPUT IS REQUESTED.

	CONTROL L (^L)
	---------

	A CONTROL L (^L) TYPED DURING INPUT OR OUTPUT COMPLEMENTS
	THE LINE PRINTER SELECTION FLAG TO DIRECT ALL NORMAL TYPEOUT
	TO THE TELETYPE OR TO THE LINE PRINTER.  (ONLY IF LP SELECTED.)

	CONTROL X (^X)
	---------

	A CONTROL X (^X) TYPED DURING PDP-10 TELETYPE OPERATIONS WILL
	PERFORM A CONSOLE COMMAND WITH THE FOLLOWING DATA.  THE PDP-10
	OPERATION IS THEN CONTINUED FROM THE POINT OF INTERRUPTION.
	DURING MONITOR TTY SUPPORT A CONTROL X (^X) WILL CAUSE THE 
	CONSOLE TO REVERT TO CONSOLE COMMAND MODE.

C.	"KLINIK" REMOTE TERMINAL OPERATIONS

	THE FIELD SERVICE REMOTE DIAGNOSTIC TERMINAL (KLINIK) IS
	ENABLED, IF OFF, BY TYPING "KLINIK" ON THE CONSOLE TTY.
	IT IS DISABLED BY THE SECOND TYPIN OF "KLINIK".  THE CONSOLE
	TTY IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN ENABLE THE USE OF "KLINIK".
	THE REMOTE TTY MUST HAVE DAILED IN AND ESTABLISHED CONTACT
	BEFORE THE "KLINIK" COMMAND IS TYPED ON THE CONSOLE TTY.
	IF AT ANY TIME THE DL11E LOOSES "CLEAR TO SEND" THE "KLINIK"
	TERMINAL WILL BE DISCONNECTED.  THE REMOTE USER MAY DISCONTINUE
	USE OF THE "KLINIK" FACILITY BY TYPING "KLINIK" AND SHOULD DO
	SO BEFORE HANGING UP.
	IF THE CONSOLE IS POWERED OFF AND THEN POWERED BACK UP THE
	"KLINIK" FACILITY IS AUTOMATICALLY CLEARED.  THE LOCAL
	CONSOLE USER MUST THEN TYPE "KLINIK" TO REESTABLISH THE "KLINIK"
	FACILITY.

D.	LINE PRINTER OPERATIONS

	--

	THIS COMMAND ASK THE FOLLOWING QUESTION FOR LINE PRINTER
	SELECTION.

	LINE PRINTER, Y OR N ? -

	THE LINE PRINTER IS THEN USED ACCORDINGLY.  IF THE LINE
	PRINTER GOES OFF LINE OR HAS AN ERROR WHILE RUNNING THE
	LINE PRINTER SELECTION FLAG IS CLEARED AND THE PRESENT

11.0	SPECIAL PROGRAM OPERATORS

	1.  PRGCMD

		THIS EMT PROVIDES A MEANS FOR A PROGRAM TO PERFORM
		OPERATOR TYPE CONSOLE COMMANDS.

		THE ADDRESS OF AN ASCIZ STRING CORRESPONDING TO THE
		DESIRED COMMANDS IS LOADED INTO R0, THEN THE EMT IS
		PERFORMED.  IF R0 = 0, THEN THE CURRENT INPUT BUFFER
		IS USED.  IF R0 = -1, THEN THE CURRENT OUTPUT BUFFER
		CONTENTS ARE USED, THE OUTPUT BUFFERS POINTERS ARE
		RESET TO PREVENT SUBSEQUENT PRINTING.

		THE ROUTINE WILL TAKE THE C-BIT CLEAR RETURN WHEN THE
		COMMANDS ARE COMPLETED.  IF AN ERROR OCCURS THE
		CORRESPONDING ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE PRINTED AND THE
		C-BIT SET RETURN WILL BE TAKEN.

		USAGE:	MOV	#COMMAND,R0
			PRGCMD			;CALL
			BCS	ERROR		;FAILED
			NEXT INST		;PASSED

	2.  PRGNPT

		THIS EMT PERFORMS AS GIVEN IN THE "PRGCMD" COMMAND
		EXCEPT PREVENTS PRINTING OF OUTPUT FOR PRINT TYPE
		'KLDCP' COMMANDS.  THE OUTPUT POINTERS ARE LEFT IN
		PLACE SO THE DATA MAY BE PROCESSED BY THE CALLING
		PROGRAM.

	3.  TENSW

	THIS EMT COMBINES THE PDP-11 CONSOLE SWITCHES AND THE PDP-10
	TYPED IN SWITCHES INTO A 36 BIT WORD AND DEPOSITS IT INTO
	THE DTE20 $DTSWR" COMMUNICATION AREA SWITCH REGISTER WORD.
	THE PDP-11 CONSOLE SWITCHES ARE SWITCHES 0 TO 15 OF THE PDP-10
	SWITCH WORD.  THE DEPOSIT IS DONE ON STD, STM, STL & DDT
	COMMANDS AND ON ANY PDP-11 CONSOLE SWITCH OR "SW" TYPED
	IN SWITCH CHANGE.  C-BIT SET ERROR RETURN IF THE
	DEPOSIT & VERIFY FAILS.

	4.  TENSP

		THIS EMT PROVIDES A COMMON METHOD OF CLEARING THE
		PDP-10 RUN FLOP, THE TEN RUNNING CONTROL FLAG AND
		THE TEN CLOCK RUNNING CONTROLS.

	A.  TTY OUTPUT

	1. THIS ROUTINE RESETS THE PDP-10 INPUT POINTERS, FLUSHES
	   ANY EXTRA TYPEIN.
	2. PICKS UP LOWER BYTE OF DTE20 COMMAND WORD,
	   STRIPS TO 7 BITS AND CALLS THE "$LDBUF" ROUTINE TO PUT
	   THE CHARACTER INTO THE OUTPUT BUFFER.  THIS BUFFER GETS
	   PRINTED UPON INSERTION OF A LINE FEED, A BELL, OR A NULL
	   CHARACTER OR UPON EXCEEDING THE BUFFER CAPACITY OF 140
	   BYTES.
	3. NOTIFIES PDP-10 TO CONTINUE

	B.  PROGRAM CONTROL

	1. HALT, CLEARS PDP-10 RUNNING FLAG AND REPORTS
	   "KL10 HALTED PC/123456", THEN RETURNS TO CONSOLE MODE.
	2. FATAL HALT, CLEARS PDP-10 CLOCK FLAG TO STOP CLOCK INTERRUPTS
	   THEN NOTIFIES THE PDP-10 TO CONTINUE.  THE PDP-10 SUBROUTINE
	   PROGRAM WILL TRANSFER TO DDT IF LOADED OR HALT AT THE
	   PROGRAM START ADDRESS.
	3. ERROR HALT, CLEAR PDP-10 CLOCK FLAG AND PDP-10 RUNNING FLAG,
	   THEN NOTIFIES PDP-10 TO CONTINUE.  THE PDP-10 WILL THEN HALT.
	4. END OF PROGRAM, PERFORMS THE "ERREOP" ROUTINE TO RETURN
	   TO CONSOLE MODE IF RUNNING STAND-ALONE, OR TO PROCEED TO
	   THE NEXT PROGRAM IF RUNNING UNDER SCRIPT OPERATION OR
	   THE "J" INDIRECT COMMAND FILE OPERATION.
	5. END OF PASS, PERFORMS THE "EOP" ROUTINE TO REPORT 
	   "END OF PASS #." AND DECREMENT THE PROGRAM ITERATION COUNT
	   AND CHECK FOR COMPLETION.  CONTINUE PROGRAM OPERATION IF
	   ALL REQUESTED ITERATIONS ARE NOT YET COMPLETED.  IF
	   COMPLETED, PERFORMS THE "ERREOP" CALL AS ABOVE.
	   NOTE: PDP-10 PROGRAMS ARE PRESENTLY SETUP TO REPORT
	   COMPLETION OF THE FIRST PASS AND THEN EVERY HUNDRETH PASS.

	B.  PROGRAM CONTROL (CON'T)

	7.  "DIAMON" FILE SELECTION

	WHEN THIS COMMAND IS PERFORMED DIAMON MUST PREVIOUSLY HAVE
	LOADED INTO THE OUTPUT BUFFER THE REQUESTED FILE NAME AND
	EXTENSION.  THIS COMMAND THEN TRANSFERS THE OUTPUT BUFFER
	TO THE INPUT BUFFER, PROCESSES THE NAME.EXT, SETS THE LOAD
	CONTROL TO HELP, SETS THE 'DIAFLG' TO CONTROL FILE PROCESSING
	AND PASSES CONTROL TO THE "DEVFIL" ROUTINE TO LOOKUP THE
	FILE.

	WHEN THE FILE IS FOUND "DEVFIL" RETURNS TO "DIAFND" WHICH SETS
	THE LOW 16 BITS OF THE $DTF11 WORD TO ZERO AND DOES A PDP-10
	COMMAND CONTINUE.

	IF THE FILE IS NOT FOUND "DEVFIL" RETURNS TO "DIANF" WHICH SETS
	THE LOW 16 BITS OF THE $DTF11 WORD TO -1 AND DOES A PDP-10
	COMMAND CONTINUE.

	8.  "DIAMON" FILE READ

	THIS COMMAND PROCESSES DATA FROM THE SELECTED FILE.  UP TO FIVE
	ASCII CHARACTERS ARE READ FROM THE INPUT FILE LINE AND COMBINED
	INTO A 36 BIT PDP-10 WORD WHICH IS THEN DEPOSITED INTO THE
	$DTF11 WORD AND A PDP-10 COMMAND CONTINUE PERFORMED.  DATA
	IS PROCESSED IN THIS MANNER WITH A NEW FILE DATA LINE REQUESTED
	WHEN REQUIRED.  WHEN THE END-OF-FILE IS REACHED A 36 BIT
	MINUS ONE IS DEPOSITED INTO THE $DTF11 WORD, TO SIGNIFY EOF
	TO THE PDP-10, AND A PDP-10 COMMAND CONTINUE PERFORMED.

	THE "DIAMON" FILE SELECTION AND READ ROUTINES WILL OPERATE
	FROM WHATEVER DEVICE IS SELECTED.  THIS INCLUDES THE RP04,
	DECTAPE AND THE ACT10 COMMUNICATIONS LINE.

	9.  PDP-10 PROGRAM COMMAND

	WHEN THIS COMMAND IS PERFORMED THE PDP-10 MUST PREVIOUSLY HAVE
	LOADED INTO THE OUTPUT BUFFER THE APPROPRIATE "KLDCP" COMMAND.
	THIS COMMAND IS THEN USED TO CAUSE A "PRGCMD" TO BE PERFORMED
	USING THE CONTENTS OF THE OUTPUT BUFFER.

	WHEN THE COMMAND IS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY THE LOW 16 BITS OF
	THE $DTF11 WORD ARE SET TO ZERO AND A PDP-10 COMMAND CONTINUE
	PERFORMED.

	IF THE COMMAND HAS AN ERROR THE LOW 16 BITS OF THE $DTF11 WORD
	ARE SET TO -1 AND A PDP-10 COMMAND CONTINUE PERFORMED.

	NOTE: EXTREME CARE MUST BE USED WHEN USING THIS OPERATION AS IT
	      IS POSSIBLE TO DO ANY "KLDCP" COMMAND INCLUDING MASTER
	      RESETTING THE KL10.  ALSO, NOT ALL COMMANDS WILL RETURN TO
	      CONTINUE THE PDP-10.

	C.  CLOCK CONTROL

	1. DISABLE CLOCK, TURNS OFF CLOCK INTERRUPTS OF THE PDP-10 BY
	   THE PDP-11.
	2. ENABLE, TURNS ON CLOCK INTERRUPTS OF THE PDP-10 BY
	   THE PDP-11.
	   ON EVERY CLOCK TICK THE PDP-11 WILL DEPOSIT -1 INTO THE
	   "$DTCLK" LOCATION OF THE PDP-10.  THE PDP-11 THEN
	   DOORBELL INTERRUPTS THE PDP-10.
	3. ENABLE & WAIT, EXAMINE $DTT11 TO GET THE CLOCK WAIT COUNT AND
	   THEN AFTER WAITING THIS MANY CLOCK TICKS PERFORM AS GIVEN IN
	   2.  ABOVE.  ONLY THE LOWER 16 BITS OF THE CLOCK WAIT DATA 
	   FROM $DTT11 ARE USED.
	4. READ CLOCK COUNT, DEPOSIT INTO $DTF11 THE CLOCK COUNT SINCE
	   ENABLED BY EITHER OF THE CLOCK ENABLE COMMANDS.

	NOTE: EITHER OF THE CLOCK ENABLE COMMANDS ALSO SYNC'S THE PDP-10
	      PROGRAM TO THE CLOCK BY CLEARING THE CLOCK FLAG AND THEN
	      WAITING FOR IT TO TICK BEFORE RETURNING CONTROL TO THE
	      PDP-10 PROGRAM.

	D.  SWITCHES

	1. READ SWITCHES, DEPOSIT CONTENTS OF WORD TYPED IN BY
	   "SW" COMMAND INTO PDP-10 $DTF11.
	2. THE PDP-10 CONSOLE SWITCHES ARE DEPOSITED INTO $DTSWR
	   WHEN ANY OF THE START COMMANDS ARE PERFORMED AND ALSO
	   WHEN THEY ARE CHANGED BY CHANGING THE PDP-11 CONSOLE
	   SWITCHES OR WHEN THE "SW" COMMAND IS USED TO MODIFY
	   THE LOWER 20 SWITCHES.

	E.  TELETYPE INPUT

	1. THIS ROUTINE CHECKS FOR AWAITING TYPEOUT, IF SO, PRINTS IT.
	2. CHECKS PDP-10 INPUT BUFFER, IF CHARACTERS AVAILABLE, PASSES
	   ONE TO THE PDP-10 THRU $DTF11.  IF NONE AVAILABLE, CALLS THE
	   "TTILIN" ROUTINE TO PROCESS A LINE OF TYPEIN.  THE TYPED-IN
	   LINE IS THEN TRANSFERED TO THE PDP-10 INPUT BUFFER & A CHAR
	   PASSED TO THE TEN THRU $DTF11.
	   USING THE "TTILIN" ROUTINE ALLOWS ALL OF THE FEATURES
	   OF THIS ROUTINE TO BE USED TO PROVIDE RUBOUT &
	   CONTROL U CAPABILITIES.
	3. NOTIFIES THE PDP-10 TO CONTINUE WITH A CHARACTER IN $DTF11.

	F.  DDT TTY INPUT MODE

	1. THIS ROUTINE IS A CHARACTER BASED OPERATION AND PASSES TYPEIN
	   FROM THE KEYBOARD DIRECTLY TO THE PDP-10 WITH NO PROCESSING
	   AND NO ECHOING.
	2. THE ROUTINE CHECKS FOR AWAITING TYPEOUT, IF SO, 
	   PRINTS IT.
	3. PERFORMS THE "TTLOOK" ROUTINE TO PROCESS CHARACTERS DIRECTLY
	   FROM THE KEYBOARD.
	4. IF NO CHAR HAS BEEN TYPED, RETURNS ZERO IN $DTF11.
	5. SETS THE CONSOLE COMMAND PROCESSOR INTO DDT INPUT MODE SO
	   THAT ANY AND ALL TYPEINS ARE RESERVED FOR DDT.  THIS MODE
	   WILL STAY IN EFFECT FOR 5 SECONDS IF NO FURTHER DDT INPUT
	   CALLS ARE PERFORMED.  THE CONSOLE WILL THEN REVERT TO
	   NORMAL COMMAND PROCESSING.
	6. A CONTROL C (^C) TYPED IN WILL ABORT THE DDT INPUT
	   MODE AND REVERT TO NORMAL COMMAND MODE.  A DDT INPUT CALL
	   MUST BE IN PROCESS FOR THIS TO BE SEEN HOWEVER, THERFORE
	   THE TIMEOUT AS GIVEN ABOVE WILL RETURN TO CONSOLE MODE
	   IF NO FURTHER DDT INPUT REQUESTS ARE PERFORMED.
	7. DDT INPUT MODE WILL ALSO BE CLEARED BY DOING EITHER OF
	   THE PRINT CONTROL COMMANDS.
	8. A CONTROL X (^X) TYPED IN WILL CAUSE THE FOLLOWING CHARS
	   TO BE USED AS A CONSOLE COMMAND.  CONTROL IS THEN RETURNED
	   BACK TO THE DDT TTY INPUT PROCESS.

	G.  MONITOR TTY OUTPUT

	THIS MODE IS A SPECIAL PDP-10 MONITOR SUPPORT MODE THAT
	ALLOWS THE CONSOLE TELETYPE TO FUNCTION AS A TIME-SHARING
	TERMINAL.  WHEN THE CONSOLE IS OPERATING AS A USER TTY THE
	TELETYPE INPUT AND OUTPUT BELONG ENTIRELY TO THE PDP-10.
	THE PDP-10 USING THE MONITOR TTY OUTPUT COMMAND CODE SENDS
	CHARACTERS DIRECTLY TO THE TTY PRINTER AND THEN GETS A DTE20
	DONE INTERRUPT WITH THE "$DTMTD" FLAG SET WHEN THE TTY IS READY
	TO ACCEPT ANOTHER CHARACTER.  WHEN A CHARACTER IS TYPED ON
	THE KEYBOARD THE CHARACTER IS DEPOSITED IN THE "$DTF11" WORD,
	THE "$DTMTI" FLAG SET AND A DTE20 INTERRUPT PERFORMED.

	H.  MONITOR MODE CONTROL ON

	THIS COMMAND PUTS THE CONSOLE IN MONITOR SUPPORT MODE TO
	SUPPORT TIME-SHARING TERMINAL OPERATION.  THE CONSOLE MUST
	PREVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN IN THE PDP-10 RUN MODE SUPPORT OPERATION,
	ANY OF THE "START 10" COMMANDS SELECTS THIS MODE.

	I.  MONITOR MODE CONTROL OFF

	THIS COMMAND RETURNS THE CONSOLE TO NORMAL PDP-10 RUN TIME
	SUPPORT.

	J.  MONITOR MODE STATE

	THIS COMMAND PASSES TO THE TEN THE CURRENT STATE OF THE MONITOR
	MODE CONTROL FLAG.  PASSED IN LOW 16 BITS OF "$DTF11".

	NOTE:
	-----

	TO ABORT MONITOR SUPPORT MODE AND RETURN TO CONSOLE MODE THE 
	OPERATOR MAY TYPE "CONTROL X".  THIS RETURNS THE CONSOLE 
	TO PDP-10 RUN TIME SUPPORT MODE.  TO ABORT THIS MODE THE
	"CONTROL C" (^C) COMMAND MAY BE TYPED.  IF CONTROL C HAS NOT
	BEEN TYPED THE "MC" MONITOR CONTINUE COMMAND WILL RETURN THE
	CONSOLE TO MONITOR SUPPORT MODE.  IF CONTROL C HAS BEEN
	TYPED THE "RN" AND THEN THE "MC" COMMANDS MAY BE TYPED TO RETURN
	TO MONITOR SUPPORT MODE.

15.0	FILE FORMATS

	ALL OF THE PROGRAM FILES FOR THE KL10 DECSYSTEM10 ARE
	CONVERTED INTO A COMPATIBLE FILE FORMAT WHICH ALLOWS
	FOR A COMMON HANDLING PROCEDURE.  THIS FILE FORMAT IS
	LOADABLE FROM ANY STORAGE MEDIUM BOTH BY THE PDP-10 AND
	BY THE PDP-11.

	THE PROGRAM FILES CONSIST OF BINARY DATA WHICH HAS BEEN
	"ASCIIZED", THAT IS, MANIPULATED SUCH THAT 6 OR LESS BITS
	OF THE BINARY DATA ARE REPRESENTED BY A 7-BIT CHARACTER
	WHOSE VALUE RANGES FROM OCTAL 075 TO OCTAL 174.  THIS
	PROCESS IS EMPLOYED TO AVOID THE PROBLEMS WHICH WOULD BE
	ENCOUNTERED IF CERTIAN 7-BIT COMBINATIONS WERE ALLOWED
	(E.G., OCTAL 003 WOULD BE INTERPRETED AS "CONTROL C").

	"ASCIIZED" DATA IS PRODUCED FROM THE SOURCE BINARY DATA AS
	FOLLOWS:

	1.  DIVIDE THE BINARY DATA INTO 6-BIT FIELDS, STARTING WITH
	    THE LEAST SIGNIFICANT 6 BITS.  DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER
	    OF BITS IN THE SOURCE DATA, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FIELD
	    MAY BE COMPOSED OF FROM 1 TO 6 BITS.

	2.  CONVERT EACH FIELD INTO A 7-BIT CHARACTER USING THE
	    FOLLOWING PROCEDURE:

	   2A.	IF THE FIELD HAS A VALUE LESS THAN OCTAL 75, ADD
		OCTAL 100 (PRODUCING 7-BIT VALUES RANGING FROM
		OCTAL 100 TO OCTAL 174).

	   2B.	IF THE FIELD HAS VALUES OCTAL 75, 76, OR 77 USE
		THE FIELD DIRECTLY (PRODUCING 7-BIT VALUES 075,
		076, OR 077).

	EXAMPLE:

	A 16 BIT WORD CONTAINING OCTAL 176076 IS DIVIDED INTO 3 FIELDS
	(ONE 4-BIT AND TWO 6-BIT):

		17, 60, 76

	THE FIELDS ARE CONVERTED INTO 7-BIT CHARACTERS:

		117, 160, 076
